Speedrun timer for GZDoom.
Uses in-game time and does splits automatically.
Not persistent after end sequences (e.g.: ends of episodes in Doom 1).
(Something to handle this will be done someday).
Should work with hubs.

TODO: Add menu to display timers after the end of a playthrough. I've never
done anything with ZScript menus before, so this will be fun.
